This repo is for a simple script to verify if a CLI template will create duplicated IPv4 addresses with addresses. 
This script will use the Cisco DNA Center APIs to access the device and client inventories.


## Installation
requirements.txt provides the list of Python libraries needed. The script has been tested on Cisco DNA Center version 1.2.10


## Usage

Show users how to use the code. Be specific.
Use appropriate formatting when showing code snippets or command line output.
If a particular [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/sandbox/) or [Learning Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning-labs/) can be used in to provide a network or other resources to be used with this code, call that out here. 

## How to test the software

This script will load the CLI template from the file with the name "configuration_template.txt". Update the template file with the desired content.
